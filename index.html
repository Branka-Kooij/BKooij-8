           Scientists have taken notice of watermelon's high lycopene levels  about 15 to 20 milligrams per 2cup serving, according to the National Watermelon Promotion Board  some of the highest levels of any type of fresh produce. Lycopene is a phytonutrient, which is a naturally occurring compound in fruits and vegetables that reacts with the human body to trigger healthy reactions. It is also the red pigment that gives watermelons, tomatoes, red grapefruits and guavas their color.
